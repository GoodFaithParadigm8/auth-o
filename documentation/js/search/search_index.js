Azure\nDemo\nAuthentification provided by AuthO\nangular-auth0-aside\nThis repository demonstrates the use of Auth0 with Angular (with the @angular/cli) and a sample Node API with a protected route.\nDependencies\n\nNode.js with npm, Node >= 8, npm >= 5\n@angular/cli, >= 8\n\nAuth0 Application Setup\n\nGo to your Auth0 Dashboard: Applications section and click the \"+ Create Application\" button.\nName your new app and select \"Single Page Web Applications\".\nIn the Settings for your new Auth0 app, add http://localhost:4200/callback to the Allowed Callback URLs.\nAdd http://localhost:4200 to both the Allowed Web Origins and Allowed Logout URLs. Click the \"Save Changes\" button.\nIf you'd like, you can set up some social connections. You can then enable them for your app in the Application options under the Connections tab. The example shown in the screenshot above uses username/password database, Facebook, Google, and Twitter.\n\n\nNote: Set up your own social keys and do not leave social connections set to use Auth0 dev keys or you will encounter issues with token renewal.\n\nAuth0 API Setup\n\nGo to APIs in your Auth0 dashboard and click on the \"Create API\" button. Enter a name for the API. Set the Identifier to your API endpoint URL. In this example, this is http://localhost:3001/api/. The Signing Algorithm should be RS256.\nYou can consult the Node.js example under the Quick Start tab in your new API's settings. We'll implement our Node API in this fashion, using Express, express-jwt, and jwks-rsa.\n\nWe're now ready to implement Auth0 authentication on both our Angular client and Node backend API.\nInstallation\nClone this project. From the root directory, run the following commands to install dependencies for the server and client-side:\n$ npm install\n$ cd server\n$ npm install\nOpen server/config.js.example and remove .example from the file name. Then replace [YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN] with your Auth0 domain.\nOpen src/app/environments/environment.example and remove .example from the file name. Then replace [YOUR_CLIENT_ID] and [YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN] with your Auth0 application's client ID and domain.\n\nServing the project\nFrom the root of this project, run:\n$ npm startThis will concurrently serve the Angular and API servers.\nWhat is Auth0?\nAuth0 helps you to:\n\nAdd authentication with multiple authentication sources, either social like Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others, or enterprise identity systems like Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider.\nAdd authentication through more traditional username/password databases.\nAdd support for linking different user accounts with the same user.\nSupport for generating signed Json Web Tokens to call your APIs and flow the user identity securely.\nAnalytics of how, when and where users are logging in.\nPull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through JavaScript rules.\n\nCreate a Free Auth0 Account\n\nGo to Auth0 and click Sign Up.\nUse Google, GitHub, or Microsoft Account to log in.\n\nIssue Reporting\nIf you have found a bug or if you have a feature request, please report them at this repository issues section. Please do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker.
